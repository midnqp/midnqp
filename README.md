<p>Software is magic and elegant - when built with unwavering passion. 
  
I enjoy experimenting and developing opensource projects; and sharing what I discover. 

Endlessly learning and committed to it - taking one step at a time every bright day. 

In the world of software engineering, this is too feasible to be intimidated by its wide extent. However, consistency is always the key to legibility.</p>

I am a quick-learner. And the best way **to learn is to build**. As I learn a new programming language or framework or concept, I quickly build something using it. Or I note that down in the README. This reinforces and strengthens what I know.
